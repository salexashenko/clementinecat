## Hello!

My name is Clementine. I am a cat! Here are some pictures of me:



I currently live in Manhattan Beach. I roam a lot! If I come up to you on the street, most likely I am not lost and want pets. Please, pet me!
My current roaming area spans from Manhattan Beach Blvd to 8th street, though I've been known to go farther.

If you need to contact my humans (if I'm hurt or bothering you, for example) - feel free to text or call the following number:
