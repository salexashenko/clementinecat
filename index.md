## Hello!

My name is Clementine. I am a cat!

I currently live in Manhattan Beach. I roam a lot! If I come up to you on the street, it's not because I'm lost, I just want to say hi!
My current roaming area spans from Manhattan Beach Blvd to 8th street, though I've been known to venture further.

If you need to contact my humans (if I'm hurt or bothering you, for example) - feel free to text or call the following number:

(415) 988 - three six zero eight

You can also look at more pictures of me [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP2LuaEEmSEMI_F2ToZaa48KJW0i92OyRgsYPr0tesM2MzU-aGhOnXlRzIXUgmcNA?key=dHQxQWc1TW1iRnRUcERGbERYb3BZYUZia2ZOaDVB). Aren't I majestic?

P.S. Feel free to add more pictures to the album!
