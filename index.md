## Hello!

My name is Sergey Alexashenko. I once wrote a [book](http://www.corticalcircuitry.com/) about how the neocortex works, and how we can use what we know about it to build better AI algorithms.

I also sometimes write about [finance](https://seekingalpha.com/author/techgrows) and [other things](https://medium.com/@SAlexashenko). My old blog is on [Svbtle](https://salexashenko.svbtle.com).

I am interested in neuroscience, AI, finance, data science, economics and synthetic biology. I sometimes invest in startups. If you want to talk about any of the above - [say hi](mailto:s.alexashenko@gmail.com). I also reply to people on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SAlexashenko).
