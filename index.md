## Hello!

My name is Clementine. I am a cat!

I currently live in Manhattan Beach. I roam a lot! If I come up to you on the street, most likely I am not lost and want pets. Please, pet me!
My current roaming area spans from Manhattan Beach Blvd to 8th street, though I've been known to be a bold explorer.

If you need to contact my humans (if I'm hurt or bothering you, for example) - feel free to text or call the following number:

You can also look at more pictures of me [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP2LuaEEmSEMI_F2ToZaa48KJW0i92OyRgsYPr0tesM2MzU-aGhOnXlRzIXUgmcNA?key=dHQxQWc1TW1iRnRUcERGbERYb3BZYUZia2ZOaDVB). Aren't I majestic?
